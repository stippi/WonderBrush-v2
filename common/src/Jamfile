#	full paths or paths relative to the makefile can be included
# 	all files, regardless of directory, will have their object
#	files created in the common object directory.

#	in folder names do not work well with this makefile.

#		libXXX.so or libXXX.a you can simply specify XXX

#	for the objects will be used and the main target will be replaced even if
#	it looks up to date judging from file time stamps only.
